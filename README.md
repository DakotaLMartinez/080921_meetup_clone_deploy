# Phase 4, Lesson 8 Image Uploads to Cloudinary

- Setting up a Cloudinary account and configuring a new signed upload preset
- Configuring rails to sign upload requests
- Configuring react to add Cloudinary's upload widget and to persist the uploaded image to our api upon success

## Tasks

- We need to create a new signed upload preset on our cloudinary account. 
    - When we make an upload, we'll specify the preset in our client side code and it will apply the [transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations) that we specify to the image (cropping, resizing, compressing or adding effects or filters if we want)
- We need to grab our `cloud_name` as well so we can use it when we add the upload widget to our React client.
- We need to add database columns to store the image urls generated by cloudinary upon upload.
- We need to install dependencies
    - `cloudinary` and `dotenv-rails` gems for rails
    - `@cloudinary/url-gen` and `@cloudinary/react`  for the client
- We need to create a file called `.env` and add it to our `.gitignore` file so we can add our cloudinary credentials to it and keep them out of version control 
- We need to create an uploads controller to handle creating a signature that cloudinary will require before allowing the upload. 
    - This API endpoint will be protected (requiring authentication) so non-logged in users will not be able to upload to our cloudinary account. 
    - It will also allow us to keep our API_SECRET out of version control and out of our client side code. This will ensure that users can't look at our source code and use that information to upload images directly to our cloudinary account, they'll need to go through our API server first.
- We need to add an endpoint that can handle persisting an uploaded image's url (returned from cloudinary) to our backend api & database.
- We'll need to update our `UserSerializer` so that the image urls we just added will be included in the JSON response.
- We'll also create a React component that will handle opening the Cloudinary upload Widget that accepts props we can use to customize:
    - which upload preset should be used to process the image
    - what the button text should be, and
    - what should happen with the uploaded image
- We'll use the widget to handle uploading a profile picture to our account.

## Creating an Upload Preset

- In the cloudinary console, we need to visit settings/upload.
    - click the gear at the top right of the navbar and then select the Upload tab below the Settings header.
- Scroll down to the section that says **Upload presets** and find and click the link that says 'Add upload preset'
- make sure the **Signing Mode** is set to `signed`
- for the **Folder**, fill in `meetup_clone_profile_pictures`
- In the sidebar, select 'Upload Manipulations' 
- Set **Format** to `jpg`
- Below **Incoming Transformations**, click 'Edit'
    - A modal will appear, within it adjust the **width** and **height** you want to crop the image to. In our case, we want a square image, so both width and height should be the same. I'll use `600`.
    - This transformation will run on the image **before** it is saved to cloudinary.
    - For **Mode**, choose `Fill`
    - This will add a few more choices, for **Gravity**, choose: `Faces`
        - this will center the cropped image on the faces detected in the uploaded profile picture
    - You can read more about the [image transformation options for cropping and resizing here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/resizing_and_cropping)
    - Click OK to save these settings
- Below **Eager Transofrmations** click the button to **Add Eager Transformation**
    - We'll use this one to create an icon sized version of the image that will show up in our Navbar
    - Set **Width** to `60`, **Height** to `60`, **Mode** to `Fill`, and **Gravity** to `Faces`
    - This will create another smaller version of the image that will be returned when we get a response from Cloudinary after uploading from the react client
- Click the orange 'Save' button to ensure your transformations are saved to the preset

## Installing Dependencies
```
bundle add cloudinary dotenv-rails
```

```
npm i --prefix client @cloudinary/url-gen @cloudinary/react --save
```

Add this script to the bottom of the public/index.html file:

```html
<script
  src="https://widget.cloudinary.com/v2.0/global/all.js"
  type="text/javascript"
></script>
```
## Adding credentials to .env
Create a file called `.env` at the root of the project
```
touch .env
```
Copy the credentials from your cloudinary api dashboard and put them into the `.env` file on separte lines like this:
```
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=yourapikeywithnoquotesgoeshere
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=yourapisecretwithnoquotesgoeshere
```

If you open up rails console and type in `ENV['CLOUDINARY_API_KEY']` you should see the value stored in this file.

## Adding Columns for image urls to the Database

For our application, we're going to allow users to upload a profile picture. When they do, we'll store the url from cloudinary in our database. We're also going to store a thumbnail version of the image, so we'll have two columns for that.

This time I'm also going to try storing the public ID of the image so we can experiment with the React cloudinary library for triggering transformations client side if we have time!

```
rails g migration AddImageUrlsToUsers profile_picture_url profile_picture_thumbnail_url cloudinary_public_id
```

we should see something like this:

```
class AddImageUrlsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :profile_picture_thumbnail_url, :string
    add_column :users, :profile_picture_url, :string
    add_column :users, :cloudinary_public_id, :string
  end
end
```
We can run `rails db:migrate` to update our database schema.

## Creating the UploadsController

```
rails g controller api/uploads prepare
```

app/controllers/api/uploads_controller.rb
```rb
class Api::UploadsController < ApplicationController
  def prepare
    signature = Cloudinary::Utils.api_sign_request(params_to_sign, ENV['CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET'])
    render json: {
      signature: signature,
      api_key: ENV['CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'],
      upload_params: params_to_sign
    }
  end

  private

  def params_to_sign
    params.permit(:timestamp, :source, :upload_preset).to_h
  end
end
```

The signature created here will be valid for an hour and Cloudinary will require it to be present when we send the request to upload the image. Because this controller inherits from our `ApplicationController`, `confirm_authentication` will be called first, ensuring only authenticated users will able to upload to our cloudinary account.

Because we're sending data from the client and we don't want it to be visible in the url, we need to make this a `POST` request, so go into the routes and change 
```
get 'uploads/prepare'
```
to 
```
post 'uploads/prepare'
```

And while we're at it, we can move it into the api namespace that's already created in the routes file.

## Adding an endpoint for updating a User account (to add profile picture)

in config/routes.rb, add the following within the api namespace.

```rb
patch "/me", to: "users#update"
```

And then add the action to the `UsersController`

```rb
class Api::UsersController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :confirm_authentication, except: [:update]
  # ...
  def update
    if current_user.update(update_user_params)
      render json: current_user, status: :ok
    else 
      render json: user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  # ...

  def update_user_params
    params.permit(:profile_picture_url, :profile_picture_thumbnail_url)
  end
end
```

We want the authentication check before we update the profile, so we add an except to the `skip_before_action` call. We're allowing the `profile_picture_url` and the `profile_picture_thumbnail_url` to come from the client through params. These urls will be taken from the response from the cloudinary api. 

>**NOTE**: This means transformations will only happen on upload. If we want to use cloudinary transitions more heavily, we can also apply them on the fly from our react code using methods and plugins provided by the cloudinary react packages. In order to support that, we would persist the `public_id` of the image to the database instead of the url. This would allow us to use cloudinary transformations from our react code. The free plan only allows a limited number of transformations per month-25000 max I believe-so this trade off is fine with me for now!

Before we move on, one more thing we need to think about. When we get the current user back from the `/me` endpoint, we won't have the image urls we just added, so we need to update the `UserSerializer` to include those.

```rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :username, :email, :profile_picture_thumbnail_url, :profile_picture_url, :cloudinary_public_id
end
```



## Creating the `CloudinaryUpload` component

We're adding 3 props here: `preset`, `handleUpload` and `buttonText`. 

The `preset` allows us to use the upload widget with multiple upload presets on Cloudinary (so we can apply different transformations/limits in different situations). 

The `handleUpload` function is a callback that will be invoked after we get a successful upload response from cloudinary. This will allow us to persist the image data to our own api with another fetch request.

Finally, the `buttonText` allows us to use  different text content for the button that will trigger the upload widget in different situations. For our case, it will be 'Add Profile Picture' when we use the component; but, for events, it would be something like 'Add Event Poster.'

```js
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function CloudinaryUpload({
  preset,
  handleUpload,
  buttonText
}) {

  // this function will generate an id to be used in
  // targeting the element to which we'll add a click event
  // listener to trigger the upload widget to appear.
  // We're generating the id based on the button text
  // so that we'll be able to have multiple buttons with
  // different upload presents visible on the same page.
  const generateId = () => {
    const ending = buttonText.split(' ').map(w => w.toLowerCase()).join('_')
    return `upload_widget_${ending}`
  }
  
  useEffect(() => {
    window.myWidget = window.cloudinary.createUploadWidget(
      {
        cloudName: "dpkrqs9rs",
        uploadPreset: preset,
        prepareUploadParams: (cb, params) => {
          params = [].concat(params);  //params can be a single object or an array of objects
          Promise.all(params.map((body) => {
            return fetch("/api/uploads/prepare", {
              method: 'POST',
              headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
              },
              body: JSON.stringify(body)
            })
              .then(res => res.json())
          }))
            .then((results) =>
              cb(results.length === 1 ? results[0] : results)
            );
        }
      },
      (error, result) => {
        if (!error && result && result.event === "success") {
          console.log("Done! Here is the image info: ", result.info);
          handleUpload && handleUpload(result);
          window.myWidget.close();
        }
      }
    );
    document.getElementById(generateId()).addEventListener(
      "click",
      function () {
        window.myWidget.open();
      },
      false
    );
  }, [preset, handleUpload]);

  return (
    <a href="#" id={generateId()}>
      {buttonText}
    </a>
  );
}

export default CloudinaryUpload;
```

the `prepareUploadParams` option inside of the first argument passed to the `createUploadWidget` method is how cloudinary will sign the request to make sure that the user making the upload request has the proper permissions. This function will make a request to our api with the upload parameters in the body and use the response to invoke a callback that will complete the upload if the signature checks out. After that, the second argument to the `createUploadWidget` method is a callback function to handle the response from cloudinary. Upon the successful upload so we can persist the urls to our api by invoking the `handleUpload` function passed as a prop to `CloudinaryUpload`.

## Adding the Widget to our Navbar
```
import CloudinaryUpload from './CloudinaryUpload'
```

```js
<div className="relative w-52">
  <div className={`flex flex-col w-52 bg-white shadow overflow-hidden absolute space-y-3 text-lg ${navbarOpen ? 'p-4 max-h-screen' : 'p-0 max-h-0'}`}>
    <CloudinaryUpload
      preset="iiqcunzb"
      handleUpload={handleUpload}
      buttonText="Add Profile Picture"
    />
    <hr/>
    <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Logistics 

If you want to follow along today, you can clone down [this linked repository](https://github.com/DakotaLMartinez/080921_meetup_clone_deploy). The starter code will be on a branch called `starter` and I'll be writing my code in a branch called `main` because Heroku only allows deployments from a branch called `main` or `master`. If you want to practice deploying this on your own, you should clone down the repo, checkout the `starter` branch and then checkout a new branch called `master`. That way your work won't conflict with mine and if your code diverges you'll still be able to fetch and pull without unnecessary merge conflicts. At the end of today, the `main` branch will be the one with the code in it that I've deployed to Heroku.

```
git clone git@github.com:DakotaLMartinez/080921_meetup_clone_deploy.git
```

```
git checkout starter
git checkout -b master
```

If you just want to focus on paying attention to what I'm doing today and asking questions, that's totally fine too!

I'm going to come at this in two phases. First, we're going to update our dependencies and configuration in preparation to deploy and test out the deployment scripts locally, then we're going to start working with the Heroku CLI to iterate on deployments. The goal will be to think about our production environment and make as many of the necessary adjustments as we can before we start attempting deployments. Because each deployment requires another commit, we want to try and anticipate as many of the required tasks as possible before we make the commit and do the push.

We're also going to move the client application from a separate repo into a directory within this repo called `client`

```
git clone git@github.com:DakotaLMartinez/080921_meetup_clone_client.git client
```

To clone the repo into a directory called client. Next, we want to remove the reference to the client remote repository so that we don't have a nested repo:

```
rm -rf client/.git
```

### Ruby Version

You can have any of the following Ruby versions as of October 2021: 2.6.8, 2.7.4, or 3.0.2. We've recommended 2.7.4. Whichever version you've got, you'll need to run commands that look like these:

```
rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

```
gem install bundler
gem install rails
```

If you don't have one of these versions installed at the moment, open up a terminal and start it now, it sometimes can take 10-15 minutes, but you'll be able to do some other stuff in the meantime.

>NOTE: You will technically be able to deploy your application with a version of Ruby not included above, but Heroku won't offer you any support as it's not recommended due to security concerns.

## Switching to Postgres

Checking for local installation:

```
which postgres
```

or 

```
postgres --version
```

or for WSL

```
psql --version 
```

Sometimes I've seen students have [issues with Postgres on WSL](https://dakotaleemartinez.com/tutorials/postgresql-setup-on-ubuntu/) due to an older version that's installed but not active. In the lessons, the idea is presented that we should work with Postgres locally as well if we plan to use it in production. This is definitely a best practice, as it can help use prevent strange bugs from occurring down the line. But, if you are currently having issues with Postgres locally, you can most likely still deploy your application to production while using sqlite as the database to support your application in development. At scale, this is not practical as larger codebases are more likely taking advantage of features that postgres has that sqlite doesn't support, but at this point, you probably won't have any issues using Sqlite locally and Postgres in production. 

I'll go through how to configure your app for postgres locally and then also how to configure it to continue using the sqlite database we've used in development so you can see how to do that if you've been unable to resolve local issues with Postgres at this time.

### A note about Heroku

Heroku will automatically provision a new Postgres database with all of the adapter and connection information required for supporting a rails application and store all of that info in an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`. When you create an application on Heroku for your project using the `heroku create` command (provided of the heroku CLI), a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable will be created for you containing all of the following configuration options:

- adapter
- database
- username
- password
- host
- port

This means that you won't need to set any of these values for the production environment within the `database.yml` file as rails will automatically assign those when it reads the value of the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable generated by Heroku.

Here is the `config/database.yml` file from the demo deployment app in the curriculum:

```yml
# PostgreSQL. Versions 9.3 and up are supported.
#
# Install the pg driver:
#   gem install pg
# On macOS with Homebrew:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
# On macOS with MacPorts:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config
# On Windows:
#   gem install pg
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# Configure Using Gemfile
# gem 'pg'
#
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # For details on connection pooling, see Rails configuration guide
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: phase_4_deploying_demo_app_development

  # The specified database role being used to connect to postgres.
  # To create additional roles in postgres see `$ createuser --help`.
  # When left blank, postgres will use the default role. This is
  # the same name as the operating system user running Rails.
  #username: phase_4_deploying_demo_app

  # The password associated with the postgres role (username).
  #password:

  # Connect on a TCP socket. Omitted by default since the client uses a
  # domain socket that doesn't need configuration. Windows does not have
  # domain sockets, so uncomment these lines.
  #host: localhost

  # The TCP port the server listens on. Defaults to 5432.
  # If your server runs on a different port number, change accordingly.
  #port: 5432

  # Schema search path. The server defaults to $user,public
  #schema_search_path: myapp,sharedapp,public

  # Minimum log levels, in increasing order:
  #   debug5, debug4, debug3, debug2, debug1,
  #   log, notice, warning, error, fatal, and panic
  # Defaults to warning.
  #min_messages: notice

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: phase_4_deploying_demo_app_test

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['MY_APP_DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: phase_4_deploying_demo_app_production
  username: phase_4_deploying_demo_app
  password: <%= ENV['PHASE_4_DEPLOYING_DEMO_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

Note that there are some options set for the production environment here. They'll actually be ignored on Heroku because of what we discussed before. These values would only be used if we were to run a command like `RAILS_ENV=production rails db:create db:migrate` to create the production database on your local machine (where the DATABASE_URL configured by heroku won't be defined)

## Adding Postgres to the Meetup Clone

Here's what our `database.yml` file currently looks like for the meetup_clone application:

```yml
# SQLite. Versions 3.8.0 and up are supported.
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
#
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3

production:
  <<: *default
  database: db/production.sqlite3
```

All of this is currently configured for sqlite3. Assuming that we have Postgres installed properly, we'll need to add the `pg` gem to our Gemfile:

```
bundle add pg
```

This will install the gem locally add something like this to your Gemfile:

```rb
gem "pg", "~> 1.2"
```

If you've had issues with Postgres locally and are planning on keeping sqlite for the dev environment, then you'll want to do the following 2 steps:
1. Add a production group and wrap this line in it:

```rb
group :production do 
  gem "pg", "~> 1.2"
end
```
2. Move the sqlite gem to the :development, :test group
```rb
group :development, :test do
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]
  # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
  gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
end
```

If you're going ahead with full on Postgres, you'll want to remove the sqlite gem from the gemfile altogether. (I'm going to comment it out in my case so I can demonstrate both approaches)

> **NOTE**: In either case, it is important that the `sqlite3` gem not be in the default (ungrouped) part of the Gemfile as Heroku will complain if it is. (You can move `sqlite3` into the development, test group and Heroku won't mind as it only installs gems in the default and production groups)

Finally, when we deploy the application to Heroku, it'll be running on an Ubuntu machine, so we'll need to add a couple of platforms to the `Gemfile.lock` so Heroku will let the deploy go through.

```
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux --add-platform ruby
```

Once the dependencies portion is complete, we can move to updating our database configuration so we can tell rails we want to use postgres in development.

## Configuring Rails for Postgres

First, we need to update the `config/database.yml` file.
```yml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: meetup_clone_dev

test:
  <<: *default
  database: meetup_clone_test

production:
  <<: *default
```

or, if you're sticking with sqlite3 in development, something like this:

```yml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
  <<: *default
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3

test:
  <<: *default
  database: meetup_clone_test

production:
  <<: *default
```

After you've got the configuration updated here, we'll also need to create a new development database using postgres. Using sqlite, all we had to do was `rails db:migrate`. With Postgres, we'll need to run `rails db:create` first.

```bash
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

When we do this the first time, we'll have issues because our seed users don't have passwords (and thus fail the validation added by `has_secure_password`).

```rb
user = User.create(username: 'Dakota', email: 'dakota@dakota.com', bio: 'i love ruby')
user2 = User.create(username: 'DJ', email: 'dj@dj.com', bio: 'i love js')
```

let's add super insecure demo passwords for now:

```rb
user = User.create(username: 'Dakota', email: 'dakota@dakota.com', bio: 'i love ruby', password: 'password')
user2 = User.create(username: 'DJ', email: 'dj@dj.com', bio: 'i love js', password: 'password')
```

And then, try running the command again:

```
rails db:seed:replant
```

If we get no printout here, that means we're good to go! When we were using Sqlite, we could use the Sqlite explorer to view information in our database right from within VSCode. We can add a [Postgres extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ckolkman.vscode-postgres) to enable the same thing for Postgres. I recorded a quick demo of how to get started with the extension and make your first database connection. After you're set up initially, it's pretty similar to the SQLite Explorer.

## Server vs Client Side Routing
We also need to handle our routing configuration. Requests coming from our react client to the API should be routed to our API endpoints, but when we click react router links, we want the app to still work upon page refresh. For this, we need to set up a fallback route that will catch 404s and render the `public/index.html` file

```rb
get "*path", to: "fallback#index", constraints: ->(req) { !req.xhr? && req.format.html? }
```

We're adding a couple of constraints to this route. This route will apply if we're not sending a fetch request and we're sending a request for html. This will mainly apply to the first time we visit the application and if we refresh the page any time thereafter. 

We also need to create the fallback controller and its index action.

```
rails g controller fallback
```

This will give us the controller
```rb
class FallbackController < ApplicationController
  
end
```

we'll need to make 2 changes:
- Add the index action that renders the index.html file.
- Change the inheritance relationship for the controller to `ActionController::Base` instead of `ApplicationController` so that rails will be able to render an html response.

```rb
class FallbackController < ActionController::Base
  def index
    render file: 'public/index.html'
  end
end
```



To configure our client side application for building and deployment, we'll need to create a `package.json` file at the root of the project.

```bash
touch `package.json`
```

```json
{
  "name": "meetup_clone_client",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Build and Deployment Configuration for Meetup Clone's React client",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">= 14"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf public",
    "build": "npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client",
    "deploy": "cp -a client/build/. public/",
    "heroku-postbuild": "npm run clean && npm run build && npm run deploy"
  },
  "author": "DakotaLMartinez"
}
```

When we get into our heroku configuration, we'll tell Heroku that there is a node component to our application. This will tell heroku to run the heroku-postbuild script after the application is deployed. When this happens, the public directory will be removed, we'll get an npm install and a build in the client directory and all of the contents of the build directory in client will be copied into the public directory of our rails application.

The fallback route that we defined in the previous step will render the public/index.html file that is created by this step.

At this point, we can test out this configuration by running: 
```
npm run heroku-postbuild
```
from our rails directory and then
```
rails s
```

If we visit our react app in the browser and navigate around and then refresh the page and everything works then we're on the right track.

Let's try it out, log in to the application and refresh the page. Whoops!  

<details>
  <summary>
    Looks like we're seeing api data here. Why?
  </summary>
  <hr/>

  
Okay, so our client side route matches a server side route exactly. That's a problem! We need to create a namespace for our api routes so that they all start with /api and we can distinguish between them and the client side routes.

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do 
    resources :events, only: [:index, :show, :create, :update, :destroy]
    resources :groups, only: [:index, :show, :create]
    resources :user_groups, only: [:index, :create, :destroy]
    resources :user_events, only: [:index, :create, :update, :destroy]
    # resources :users
    # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
    get "/me", to: "users#show"
    post "/signup", to: "users#create"
    post "/login", to: "sessions#create"
    delete "/logout", to: "sessions#destroy"
  end

  get "*path", to: "fallback#index", constraints: ->(req) { !req.xhr? && req.format.html? }
end
```

  <hr/>

</details>
<br/>



<details>
  <summary>
    What else do we need to do here to make sure things still work right?
  </summary>
  <hr/>

Look for all occurrences within client or public of:
fetch(\`
replace with
fetch(\`/api)

All
fetch('
replace with
fetch('/api)

Finally all:
fetch(")
replace with
fetch("/api)

If we do this using the global find and replace, it should get all of the fetches (including the ones in the built code from our heroku script so we don't need to build again!)

  <hr/>

</details>
<br/>





Now, when we try it, it's not working to login and we get this in our rails server logs:

```
Started POST "/api/login" for ::1 at 2021-10-04 16:55:38 -0700
  
ActionController::RoutingError (uninitialized constant Api):
```

<details>
  <summary>
    What's the issue and how do we fix it?
  </summary>
  <hr/>

  The issue is that when we add a namespace to our routes, Rails is expecting a subdirectory within the controllers directory and a constant preceding all of our controller names. To fix this, we can run some terminal commands to move the files around (or do this manually through the VS Code interface):

```bash
mkdir app/controllers/api
mv app/controllers/events_controller.rb app/controllers/api/events_controller.rb
mv app/controllers/groups_controller.rb app/controllers/api/groups_controller.rb
mv app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb app/controllers/api/sessions_controller.rb
mv app/controllers/user_events_controller.rb app/controllers/api/user_events_controller.rb
mv app/controllers/user_groups_controller.rb app/controllers/api/user_groups_controller.rb
mv app/controllers/users_controller.rb app/controllers/api/users_controller.rb
```

Then, we need to open up those controllers and add `Api::` before each of the class names. 

>**NOTE**: When you're working on your project, you can also use the model and controller generator separately to avoid this renaming. For example

```
rails g controller api/groups
```

> This will give you a class called `Api::GroupsController` in a file at `app/controllers/api/groups_controller.rb`

  <hr/>

</details>
<br/>



Now, we can go back to the browser and submit the login form again. This time it works!

Now, let's try to refresh the page and see if we're still seeing the react app (and not api data). Now, when we refresh, we continue to see the react app.

Now that the app works when built using our configured scripts in package.json with a postgres database, we can start the heroku piece.

## Configuring Heroku via the Heroku CLI

First, we want to create a `Procfile` in the root of the project that describes how to run our application.

```
touch Procfile
```
and add this to it:
```
web: bundle exec rails s
release: bin/rake db:migrate
```

Next, you'll want to make sure you're connected to your Heroku account 
```
heroku login
```
And then you'll be redirected to the browser. Once you sign into your account and click the button, you can return to the terminal and you should be logged in. 

Once you're logged in, you can create an application on heroku that you can deploy to.

```
heroku create
```

You'll see something like this if all is well:

```
Creating app... done, ⬢ stormy-basin-85902
https://stormy-basin-85902.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/stormy-basin-85902.git
```

And this adds in a remote that you can push to that will trigger a deployment. The syntax looks like this:

```
git push heroku main
```

If you want to push up the main branch. 

## How Heroku builds our Application

Before we actually run this, we'll want to tell heroku that we have a node and ruby application and that we want to build the nodejs part first (this will build the app and copy it to the public directory). We can configure this via the CLI using the following commands.

```
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs --index 1
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby --index 2
```

When you've done both of these things, you should see something like this:

```
Buildpack added. Next release on stormy-basin-85902 will use:
  1. heroku/nodejs
  2. heroku/ruby
```

#### For node,

The Heroku Node.js buildpack is employed when the application has a package.json file in the root directory.

You can read more about [how Heroku supports nodeJS](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support) on their devcenter documentation.


#### For Ruby, 
##### Presence of Gemfile indicates a Ruby application
##### Presence of config.ru indicates a Rack application
##### Presence of config/environment.rb indicates a Rails 2 application
##### Presence of config/application.rb containing the string Rails::Application indicates a Rails 3 application
You can read more about [how Heroku supports ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support) on their devcenter documentation.

Heroku will also set the following environment variables for Rails 5+ apps:

- RAILS_ENV => “production”
- RACK_ENV => “production”
- RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT => “enabled”
- RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES => “enabled”
### Dependency installation
- Applications specifying Bundler 2.x in their Gemfile.lock will receive bundler: 2.2.21
- Applications specifying Bundler 1.x in their Gemfile.lock will receive bundler: 1.17.3

Heroku supports the following Ruby versions and the associated Rubygems. A supported version means that you can expect our tools and platform to work with a given version. It also means you can receive technical support. Here are our supported Ruby versions:

[MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI) (Matz's Ruby Interpreter):

- 2.6.8, Rubygems: 3.0.3.1
- 2.7.4, Rubygems: 3.1.6
- 3.0.2, Rubygems: 3.2.22

### Automatic Configuration of Postgres database on Heroku if your Gemfile contains a gem that uses Postgres
Also,
A dev database add-on is provisioned if the Ruby application has the a gem with a Postgres driver in the Gemfile. This populates the DATABASE_URL environment var. For more information see [Ruby Database Provisioning](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-database-provisioning).

Currently detected Postgres driver gems:

- pg
- activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter
- jdbc-postgres
- jdbc-postgresql
- jruby-pg
- rjack-jdbc-postgres
- tgbyte-activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter

What this means for us is that as long as we include the "pg" gem in the Gemfile before we deploy our application for the first time, Heroku will configure a Postgres database for us and create an environment variable for our application that Rails will automatically read from to get the necessary database connection information that ActiveRecord will use to connect to the newly created database on Heroku postgres.

>**NOTE:** Heroku only configures the add on for us on the first successful deployment, so if we somehow successfully deploy the application without adding the `"pg"` gem first, Heroku won't do this for us. This most likely won't be an issue as if you forget to update the database from sqlite you'll get a failed deployment at that point and you'll have the chance to fix the problem before the first successful deploy. This would only happen really if you removed "sqlite3" from the Gemfile and forgot to replace it with "pg"

## Deploying

Since we're going to deploy via a git push, we need to commit all of our changes before we can do the deployment.

```
git add .
git commit -m "configure for heroku"
```

Heroku will only deploy from main or master, so we're going to push the master branch up:

```
git push heroku master
```

This should take quite a while to build, deploy, install and migrate the first time, but once we're done, we can run 

```
heroku open
```
from the CLI to check out the app in the browser. The first time I did this, I got an application error. In that case, you can run:

```
heroku logs --tail
```
to see what the problem was. After scrolling through the logs, I found this message:

2021-10-05T05:57:12.258256+00:00 app[web.1]: Exiting
2021-10-05T05:57:12.258461+00:00 app[web.1]: /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/zeitwerk-2.4.2/lib/zeitwerk/loader/callbacks.rb:18:in `on_file_autoloaded': expected file /app/app/serializers/user_serializer.rb to define constant UserSerializer, but didn't (Zeitwerk::NameError)

So, I checked out that file and found this:

```rb
class ChangedUserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :username, :email
end
```
Sure enough! I needed to rename the class.

```rb
class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :username, :email
end
```

then we need to commit the change
```
git add .
git commit -m "rename serializer class"
```

Then we can try the deploy again:

```
git push heroku master
```

That should do it!!!

}
```
commands
```
heroku create
```

```
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs --index 1
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby --index 2
```
## Database

No changes other than the switch to Postgres.

## Models

No changes
## Views

No changes (heroku postbuild will copy the react app into the rails public directory)

## Controllers

Fallback controller
```rb
class FallbackController < ActionController::Base
  def index
    render file: 'public/index.html'
  end
end
```

Ensure api endpoints are namespaced under Api and stored in a directory called app/controllers/api

## Routes

```rb
get "*path", to: "fallback#index", constraints: ->(req) { !req.xhr? && req.format.html? }
```

Ensure that api endpoints are namespaced under api so that they don't conflict with client side routes.

## Usage

To deploy the application you can push the main or master branch to the heroku remote using a command like this:

```
git push heroku main
```
or

```
git push heroku master
```

### Note on Generators

When you build out your application, you can save yourself the trouble of having to move all of your routes around by using the `model` and `controller` generators separately rather than using `resource`:

```
rails g model Group
```

```
rails g controller api/groups
```
This will create the api namespace in your routes file, the `api` directory inside of `app/controllers` and add `Api::` in front of the `GroupsController` class defined within `app/controllers/api/groups_controller.rb`.
